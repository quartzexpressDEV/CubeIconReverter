# CubeIconReverter
something to revert the ugly new icons on cube
if it doesnt work for u create a new issue, if you want to improve it, create a pr
i care way too less about this to make it look good so ill review the prs asap
downloads can be found in the releases section but you can also just compile it urself, have fun
if it doesnt run you probably have to install the dotnet 5.0 runtime which can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472 but ive never tested it so hmu if it doesnt work

ah i forgot something, the pack is owned by cube, not me so dont sue me thx
